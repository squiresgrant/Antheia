> colors!


a small project i've decided to work on
to learn more about making html pages with (somewhat) pure javascript and to work with cookies</br>
[check it out on my github page;)](https://squiresgrant.github.io/colors/)

*i will upload every major version of the project here (if i remeber (lol))*

+(not going to make a tutorial, you can figure it out)

*please note, i work more in backend, making the site look good is not a priority, rather making it work good and user friendly*
